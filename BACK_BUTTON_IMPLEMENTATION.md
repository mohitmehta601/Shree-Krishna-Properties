# Back Button Implementation Summary

I have successfully added a back button to every page of the Shree Krishna Properties website. Here's what was implemented:

## New Component Created

- **BackButton.tsx**: A reusable component that creates a fixed position back button in the top-left corner

### Features:

- Fixed positioning (top-4 left-4) for consistent placement
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur for modern look
- Shadow and hover effects for better user experience
- Responsive text that shows "Back" on larger screens and just the arrow icon on mobile
- High z-index (z-50) to ensure it appears above other content

## Pages Updated

### User Pages:

1. **UserDashboard**: Added back button (when onBack prop is provided)
2. **PropertyDetail**: Replaced inline back button with BackButton component
3. **SearchResults**: Replaced inline back button with BackButton component
4. **UserInquiries**: Replaced inline back button with BackButton component

### Admin Pages:

1. **AdminDashboard**: Added back button (when onBack prop is provided)
2. **AdminInquiries**: Replaced inline back button with BackButton component
3. **AdminPropertyForm**: Replaced inline back button with BackButton component

### Authentication Pages:

1. **Login**: Added conditional back button (when onBack prop is provided)
2. **Signup**: Added conditional back button (when onBack prop is provided)

### Navigation Logic Updated:

- **App.tsx**: Updated to pass appropriate onBack callbacks to all components
- Login/Signup now have back functionality to return to Landing page
- User and Admin dashboards have back functionality to return to Landing page
- All sub-pages have back functionality to return to their respective dashboards

## Navigation Flow:

```
Landing Page
├── Login (with back to Landing)
├── Signup (with back to Landing)
├── User Dashboard (with back to Landing)
│   ├── Property Detail (with back to User Dashboard)
│   ├── Search Results (with back to User Dashboard)
│   └── User Inquiries (with back to User Dashboard)
└── Admin Dashboard (with back to Landing)
    ├── Admin Property Form (with back to Admin Dashboard)
    └── Admin Inquiries (with back to Admin Dashboard)
```

## Design Consistency:

- All back buttons have the same appearance and behavior
- Fixed position ensures they're always visible and accessible
- Professional styling that matches the overall design theme
- Semi-transparent background that works on any page background

The implementation is complete and functional. Users can now easily navigate back from any page using the consistently placed back button in the top-left corner.
