# üö® CORS 403 ERROR - QUICK FIX GUIDE

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed:

1. **Updated Supabase client configuration** - Added PKCE flow and proper headers
2. **Updated AuthContext** - Fixed email redirect URL
3. **Updated Signup component** - Better error messages
4. **Updated Vite config** - Added proper server settings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST do this NOW:

### Step 1: Configure Supabase Dashboard (5 minutes)

Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/xpxqqlvrmbavondphekq

#### 1.1 URL Configuration

Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**

Set these values:

```
Site URL: http://localhost:5173

Redirect URLs (add all of these):
- http://localhost:5173
- http://localhost:5173/**
- http://localhost:5173/callback
```

#### 1.2 Email Provider Settings

Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Email**

**For Development:**

- ‚úÖ Enable Email provider
- ‚ùå **DISABLE "Confirm email"** (uncheck the box)
- ‚úÖ Save changes

**Why?** Disabling email confirmation lets you test without setting up SMTP.

**For Production:** You'll need to re-enable this and set up proper email templates.

#### 1.3 Verify Settings

Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings**

Check:

- ‚úÖ "Enable sign-ups" is ON
- ‚úÖ "Enable email signup" is ON
- ‚úÖ No IP restrictions

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Clear storage** ‚Üí **Clear site data**
4. Or use: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` ‚Üí Clear everything for localhost

### Step 3: Test Signup

1. Your dev server should already be running
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Try to sign up with a **real email address**
4. Check the console for any errors

## üîç Still Not Working?

### Check Supabase Logs

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/xpxqqlvrmbavondphekq/logs/auth-logs
2. Look for failed signup attempts
3. The error message will tell you exactly what's wrong

### Common Issues:

#### Issue: "Failed to fetch"

- **Cause:** Supabase URL not in allowed list
- **Fix:** Add `http://localhost:5173` to Redirect URLs (Step 1.1)

#### Issue: "User already registered"

- **Cause:** Email already exists
- **Fix:** Use a different email or delete the user from Supabase Dashboard

#### Issue: "Email confirmation required"

- **Cause:** Email confirmation is still enabled
- **Fix:** Disable it in Supabase (Step 1.2)

#### Issue: Still getting 403

- **Cause:** Changes haven't propagated
- **Fix:** Wait 60 seconds and try again

## üß™ Test Your Configuration

Run this command to test your Supabase connection:

```powershell
npx tsx scripts/test-supabase-connection.ts
```

This will tell you if:

- ‚úÖ Database connection works
- ‚úÖ Auth endpoint is accessible
- ‚úÖ Signup is working
